SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
================================================================================

1.1 Scope of This Manual

This Construction Site Safety Manual establishes comprehensive safety protocols 
for all construction activities conducted by Titan Construction Corporation and 
its subcontractors. All personnel, including employees, contractors, and visitors, 
must adhere to these guidelines without exception.

1.2 Legal Compliance

This manual complies with OSHA Construction Industry Standards (29 CFR 1926), 
state regulations, and local building codes. Violations may result in disciplinary 
action, project delays, and legal penalties including fines up to $156,259 per 
willful violation as per OSHA's 2024 penalty structure.

1.3 Safety Culture

Safety is not just a priority—it is a core value. Every worker has the right to 
stop work if they observe an unsafe condition. No deadline or budget constraint 
justifies compromising worker safety.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE)
================================================================================

2.1 Mandatory PPE Requirements

All personnel on construction sites MUST wear the following at all times:

Hard Hats (ANSI Z89.1 certified):
- Type I: Protects top of head from falling objects

- Replace immediately if cracked, dented, or after any impact
- Maximum service life: 5 years from manufacture date

Safety Glasses (ANSI Z87.1 certified):
- Clear lenses for general construction
- Tinted lenses for outdoor work (UV protection)
- Side shields required at all times
- Face shields required for grinding, cutting, or chemical handling

High-Visibility Vests (ANSI/ISEA 107 Class 2 or 3):
- Class 2: General construction sites

================================================================================
SECTION 3: FALL PROTECTION GUIDELINES
================================================================================

3.1 Fall Protection Requirements

Fall protection is MANDATORY when working at heights of 6 feet or more above 
lower levels. Falls remain the leading cause of death in construction, accounting 
for 33.5% of all construction fatalities.

3.2 Fall Protection Systems

Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS):
- Full-body harness (ANSI Z359.11)
- Self-retracting lifeline (SRL) or shock-absorbing lanyard
- Anchor point rated for 5,000 lbs per worker
- Maximum free fall distance: 6 feet
- Inspection required before each use

Guardrail Systems:
- Top rail: 42 inches (+/- 3 inches) above walking surface
- Mid rail: Halfway between top rail and working surface
- Toe board: 4 inches minimum height
- Capable of withstanding 200 lbs force applied in any direction

Safety Nets:
- Maximum fall distance to net: 30 feet
- Mesh opening: Maximum 6 inches x 6 inches
- Installation by competent person only
- Weekly inspections and after any impact

3.3 Ladder Safety

Portable Ladders:
- Maintain 3-point contact at all times
- Extend 3 feet above landing surface
- Secure at top to prevent displacement
- Maximum reach: Do not overreach beyond arm's length
- Angle: 4:1 ratio (1 foot out for every 4 feet up)

Fixed Ladders:
- Cages required for heights over 20 feet
- Landing platforms every 30 feet
- Ladder safety devices for heights over 24 feet

3.4 Scaffold Safety

All scaffolds must be:
- Designed by a qualified person
- Erected by competent person
- Capable of supporting 4x intended load
- Fully planked with scaffold-grade lumber
- Equipped with guardrails and toe boards
- Inspected before each shift

Cold Weather Considerations:
- Remove ice and snow before use
- Use non-slip surfaces
- Account for wind load in calculations

================================================================================
SECTION 4: EXCAVATION AND TRENCHING SAFETY
================================================================================

4.1 Critical Hazards

Cave-ins are the greatest risk in excavation work. One cubic yard of soil weighs 
approximately 2,700 pounds—enough to crush a worker instantly. Excavation fatalities 
have a survival rate under 10%.

4.2 Protective Systems

All excavations over 5 feet deep require protective systems:

Sloping:
- Type A soil: 3/4:1 ratio (53-degree angle)
- Type B soil: 1:1 ratio (45-degree angle)
- Type C soil: 1.5:1 ratio (34-degree angle)

Shoring:
- Hydraulic aluminum systems
- Timber shoring per engineered design
- Install from top down, remove from bottom up

Trench Boxes:
- Must extend 18 inches above surrounding area if no sloping
- Do not use as heavy equipment supports
- Keep within 2 feet of the trench face

4.3 Daily Inspection Requirements

A competent person must inspect excavations:
- At the start of each shift
- After rain or water intrusion
- After any event that could affect stability
- Documented on Daily Excavation Inspection Form

4.4 Emergency Access

- Ladder, ramp, or stairway required every 25 feet of lateral travel
- Emergency extraction equipment on-site
- Two workers minimum for all trench work (buddy system)

================================================================================
SECTION 5: ELECTRICAL SAFETY PROCEDURES
================================================================================

5.1 Electrical Hazard Recognition

Electrocution is the fourth leading cause of construction fatalities. 
Common hazards include:
- Contact with overhead power lines
- Damaged extension cords and power tools
- Improper grounding
- Working in wet conditions

5.2 Minimum Approach Distances

For unqualified workers:
- 0-50 kV: 10 feet minimum
- 50-200 kV: 15 feet minimum
- 200-350 kV: 20 feet minimum
- 350-500 kV: 25 feet minimum

5.3 Lock-Out/Tag-Out (LOTO) Procedures

Before any electrical work:
1. Notify all affected workers
2. Identify all energy sources
3. Isolate equipment from energy sources
4. Apply locks and tags
5. Release stored energy
6. Verify zero energy state

Only the worker who applied the lock may remove it. Violation of LOTO 
procedures is grounds for immediate termination.

5.4 Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs)

GFCIs are REQUIRED for all:
- 120-volt, single-phase, 15- and 20-ampere receptacles
- Temporary wiring on construction sites
- Outdoor and wet location outlets

Test GFCIs before each use using the test/reset buttons.
